# DrivebyFix

DrivebyFix is a standalone mod for GTA: San Andreas that enables player collision for peds when they driveby. This reenables a proper hitbox for them, allowing them to take damage based on their actual skin position.
There are other ways to accomplish this â€” this is an example of one of them.

Note that this modification may be disallowed on SA-MP servers as it subjectively provides an advantage over other players.

This can be built in to a Visual Studio solution using premake5.
